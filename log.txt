    Annotation subproperty/domain/range disappear after save/load cycle
    (punning enhancement) #351
    
    This feature is not supported in RDF/XML as it is not supported by the
    stantard OWL 2 DL mapping to RDF.
    It works in Functional syntax, as it does not have to go through RDF
    (where the range triple is the same one for both datatype and annotation
    property).

    Part of Add transactional support to OWLOntology #382
    
    The ability to rollback the application of a set of changes if one
    fails is part of this feature.
    Added a ChangeApplied.NO_OPERATION to track those changes that did not
    have any effect (e.g., adding an axiom that is already present or
    removing an axiom that is not present). Those changes do not need
    rollback in case of errors/vetoes.
    Unsuccessful changes are almost exclusively vetoed changes or illegal
    renames - e.g., cannot rename an ontology to a new name already used by
    an ontology currently loaded. Automatic rollbacks are therefore expected
    to be rare.

    Fix Losing Annotations on Annotation Assertion Axioms #406
    
    The bug was an ancient one to do with comparing OWLObjects of the same
    type. Axioms should have taken into account annotations but weren't.
    Likely this was brought to light when we started using TreeSets for
    collection of axioms for output.

    - Removed ParsableOWLOntologyFactory (replaced with
    OWLOntologyFactoryImpl  #393)
    - Removed AbstractInMemOWLOntologyFactory (replaced with
    OWLOntologyFactoryImpl #393)
    - Added annotations for CachingEnabled and CompressionEnabled so that
    these parameters can be injected by Guice.
    - Added assisted inject as a dependency
    - Create a fresh injector per OWLOntologyManager object graph (#392)
    - Added a test case for ConcurrentPriorityCollection
    - Added a test case for ConcurrentOWLOntologyImpl
    - Added a test case for Concurrent OWLOntologyBuilder
    - Added an implementation of OWLOntologyBuilder for building concurrent
    ontologies
    - Added an implementation of OWLOntologyBuilder for building
    non-concurrent ontologies.
    - Changed the OWLAPIImplModule so that it creates concurrent ontologies
    and managers by default (we could add a NoOp ReadWriteLock here for
    non-concurrent impls).

    Fix Using a PriorityCollection for IRI mappers (and perhaps other
    things) is confusing #386
    
    This commit introduces PriorityCollectionSorting as a parameter in
    OWLOntologyConfigurationLoader. The enum value set in the configuration
    is used to sort values in the PriorityCollection instances.
    The default value sorts the collection only when calling set(Set) on it
    - this happens when Guice injection is performed.
    Calling set(Iterable) or set(T...), as well as any variant of add(),
    does not apply any sorting. The add() methods add their arguments at the
    top of the list, so calling multiple adds causes the collection to
    behave like a stack.
    Any changes in sorting configuration on the
    OWLOntologyConfigurationLoader for the manager being used become active
    after the first set() or add() call.

    Could be smarter, and check to see if they are used on entities in the ontology being written, but it's not really worth it.

    Sort untyped IRI Annotation Assertions.
    Sort general axioms, then render each axiom individually (this is probably  not  necessary anymore).
    Sort axioms when creating a graph.
    Create inner subclass of  RDFTranslator that uses allocates sequentially numbered blank nodes, keeping track of allocated ids in a map in the owning ontology. This map persists for the life of the renderer, and can retain some garbage longer than necessary because blank nodes (actually because sublists). A weak map would waste more memory on average.
    
    Blank nodes are thus numbered in the order in which the object that required them is visited.
    RootAnonymousNodes are sorted before rendering, since blank node order is meaningful.
    
    Rio Rendering tests have expected minimum sizes  adjusted to cope with blank-nodes that starting at 1, rather than being equal to the object's hash code.
    
    Also KoalaWithPhD still makes me giggle.

    Related to #363
    
    There's a number of uses of Filters.annotations, which is slow due to
    lack of use of the annotation assertion axioms index.
    The main reason to use it is the INCLUDED/EXCLUDED flag, which is not
    available on OWLOntolgy::getannotationAssertionAxioms(AnnotationSubject
    i), and so requires an extra cycle over imports closure. But alas,
    changing it is an interface change.

    Major reworking of the osgi bundle.
    
    Everything is embedded transitively, except for slf4j-api (for reasons noted in earlier commit message).
    
    Everything except for the locally compiled classes is embedded as a jar, and only owlapi packages are exported; this restricts the visibility of the embedded jars to just the owlapi bundle, so they don't stomp on everyone else.
    I am as keen on embedding everything   now that there are so many dependencies.

    Test to see if the osgibundle is startable, and if an OWLManager instance can be created.
    
    The slf4j-api and slf4j-simple bundles are started before starting the owlapi bundle
    
    It does not seem possible to start slf4j if it is embedded as a jar; this means that a  simple-logger on the classs path, or as a bundle fragment, will not be found.

    Custom junit runner for Annotation Pun tests. The two-way pun tests
    checked all 2-way permutations of six entity types, using 4 different
    formats, with each version being round tripped ten times.
    
    Now it  checks all 2-way combinations (15 * 4 instead of 36 * 4), but
    exposes them as independent  tests, which means they can be run
    separately).

    Generate javadoc in the default package phase...
    but default to skipping javadoc creation unless maven is called with the property no-javadoc set to false .
    e.g.
    
     mvn install -Dno-javadoc=false
    
     There is a standard property, maven.javadoc.skip, which defaults to true.
    It is possible to add a configuration line setting the property to false.
     It is not possible to override that setting.
     It is possible to define a user property, give that a default setting of false, use it to set the skip property, and override that if you do want javadocs.
    
     That's So Maven.

    Same fix as #358 without the use of threadlocals
    
    The XMLWriterPreferences change is not exactly equivalent to the fix in
    version 3.x because threads can still change the settings before the
    writer gets hold of a copy of the preferences; however this happens
    before any output is generated, so if threads interact the output will
    use different settings but will do so consistently.
    XMLWriterPreferences should be immutable and create copies on modify;
    however, to allow client code to push modified preferences to the writer
    would require interface changes.

    Port forward patch to handle DisjointClassAxioms with only a single
    argument.

commit 019b1c91e2b0b7749e694afcff268bc5745c25d6
Author: Simon Spero <sesuncedu@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 14 21:12:56 2014 +0100

    When the data factory is asked to construct a DisjointClassAxiom given
    only a single class expression,
    assume that the original form of the expression had two identical
    arguments.
    
    This should have the semantics of making the class equivalent to
    Nothing.
    
    We a second class expression to the set:
    If the class expression is not owl:Thing, make it disjoint with
    owl:Thing.
    
     If the classExpression is owl:Thing, add owl:Nothing;  this lets the
    axiom have two arguments, and is semantically void;   we could make
    owl:Thing disjoint with not(owl:Nothing), but I'm just going for
    syntactic viability in this case.   There are many other ways for expert
    users to make an ontology inconsistent.
    
      All changes are annotated (with an annotated annotation), noting the
    change, and noting the version of the API and the time when the change
    was made.  rdfs:comment is used as the annotation property to avoid
    declaration issues (making the change at the data factory level means we
    don't have access to the ontology).

    On hotspot with compressed OOPS, each set is 24 bytes (- a singleton set is 16 bytes).
    
    A Trove set with load factor 0.75, with a capacity of 3 elements uses 88 bytes - 48 bytes of set data, plus 40 bytes for a 5 element array (arrays have a 20 byte header, and are padded to 8 byte boundaries).

    fix #299 roundtrip errors on TriX and various other syntaxes
    
    The problem comes from the fact that these syntaxes have explicit blank
    node ids outputted, where Turtle, for example, outputs [] nodes
    repeating triples when structure sharing happens.
    In TriX, duplicate triples are not emitted and shared structure is
    outputted only once. On parsing, though, the triples get consumed the
    first time they are found (which is expected behaviour, see reference),
    and the second reference to the blank node does not have any triples
    associated, hence the Error1 situation.

    Ignore JSON-LD until decision on whether/how to make it round trippable.
    (The JSON-LD parser/renderer are aggressive about removing and adding xsd:string from plain literals with no lang
     tag)

Date:   Mon Sep 29 14:26:28 2014 -0400

     Don't force addMissingTypes to false for RDF Formats, whilst leaving it set for others.
     (With JSONLD ignored), this reduces the number of failed tests from 26 to 14.
    
     With missing types added, there are 5 test cases with failures.
     Without missing types added, there are 8 test cases with failures.

    fix #292 SWRL rules saved by older versions of OWLAPI/Protege lose
    annotations
    
    The simple renderer was not printing SWRLRule annotations.
    When SWRL rules have IRIs, the IRI is remapped to a blank node IRI in
    order to stop annotations being wrongly attached to IRIs rather than
    axioms.

    Manchester editor parser renamed to ManchesterOWLSyntaxParserImpl
    
    This uniforms the name to the interface implemented.
    This commit also adds a factory method in OWLManager for the interface,
    and adds a Provider pattern for classes that need to be able to create
    a default loading configuration, overriding it if necessary.
    
    Tests updated to use the wired implementation rather than instantiating
    the parser manually.
    
    Methods added to the interface to allow strings to parse to be passed
    in, and other necessities.

    Remove no argument constructor from OwlOntologyChangeRecord.

    Since OwlOntologyChangeRecord is serializable, it does not need the no-arg constructor.

    This change makes a minor break in the OWLReasoner interface.
    However, a few reasoners compatible with 3.5 use methods that have
    changed already, so they will need minor changes to work with 4.0
    anyway.

    Fix to failing-to-fail and failing-to-detect-fail-to-fail  test case.
    
    Utf8TestCase::testInvalidUTF8roundTrip has two errors.
    
    1) String::getBytes is called with no arguments, which uses the default
    charset encoder to generate an octet stream.
       With a default charset of UTF-8, this results in a valid UTF-8 octet
    stream.
       Unfix lack of error by bytes as ISO_8859_1.
    
     2) The call to loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument was succeeding on the
    valid UTF-8 stream, and hitting
     the fail statement.  Unfortunately, the catch block was catching
    Throwable, rather than Exception.  Since Throwable is a superclass of
    the AssertionError thrown by fail, the call to fail to indicate a
    failure to fail was getting caught as if the method had successfully
    failed. (Prime Minister).
    
     With these changes in place, the bad octet in the UTF-8 stream is
    detected and an  exception  is thrown.

    error in parsing annotated axioms where lists are involved
    
    A datatype declaration axiom with an annotation and a faceted data
    range would not be parsed correctly due to the order of the mop up
    actions - other handlers would steal some of the triples from the
    facet list before the annotated axiom handler got to them.
    
    This bug did not exist in 3.5.0-SNAPSHOT. Might have resulted from
    other bug fixes recently added to consume triples for annotations
    with blank subject and literal annotation.

    LoggingReasonerProgressMonitor (which might be a sensible class

     Add a few not-null assertions in otherwise empty loops.
    
     In testMergedOntology, create an example, non-empty ontology to allow
    so that merge runs and existing axioms pass.

    to allow adding axioms to an immutable ontology at construction time -
    currently all changes go through the mutable interface.

    Fixes #20 and #60 use zipped buffer for StreamDocumentBase
    
    StriamDocumentBase buffers the content of any stream/reader to allow for
    rewinding for multiple parsers. The memory buffer can grow to large
    sizes for large ontologies and text based formats compress very well, so
    zipping the buffer is useful to reduce memory footprint.

Date:   Sun Feb 23 10:59:06 2014 +0000

    split Guice module across providing packages.
    
    This change allows for unit tests to be moved closer to their targets,
    as for example now fixers only needs to create an injector from impl,
    rather than depending on apibinding for that.
    It also enables dropping a module altogether, e.g., in order to not use
    OBOparser at all, all that's needed is to create an injector without the
    OBO module.

    OpenJDK tests have failed because of an ordering issue that cannot be
    repeated on Oracle JDKs - anonymous nodes are not renamed consistently
    when verifying roundtripping of turtle ontologies.
    
    This fix works around the ordering issue in the test. Note that the
    difference in roundtripping is semantically irrelevant.

    asPairwiseAxioms implemented for all nary axiom types

commit 5d2e4c60db6799b41f816aa4ef34a495dc2c8c1e
Author: Joshua Taylor <joshuaaaron@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Jan 11 10:40:45 2014 +0000

    Updated the OWLParser documentation to reflect the fact that parsers
    *add* the axioms of the parsed ontology to an existing ontology
    object, rather than making the ontology object contain *exactly* the
    axioms of the parsed ontology.  Also cleaned up the links to
    OWLManager#makeLoadImportRequest.
    
    Added notes that the typical useage of OWLParsers is by
    OWLOntologyManagers to populate empty ontology objects, and clarified
    ambiguous wording about the documentIRI argument (don't conflate an
    IRI that an ontology can be loaded from and the ontology IRI of the
    ontology).

Author: ignazio <ignazio.palmisano@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Jan 7 18:28:40 2014 +0000

    Changed variable rendering in Manchester OWL Syntax to preserve ns.
    
    Variables like <urn:swrl#x> are rendered as ?x.
    Strings like ?x are parsed as <urn:swrl#x>
    
    Variables like <foo#x> are rendered as ?<foo#x>.
    Strings like ?<foo#x> are parsed as <foo#x>.
    
    This allows for parsing of simple forms and preserves namespaces in
    roundtripping if a different namespace is used.

    Fixes SF 101 Manchester OWL Syntax Parser doesn't do precedence
    correctly
    
    a and b or c was parsed as a and (b or c)
    This was caused by the parsing done as
    parseIntersection -> parseUnion -> parseNonNaryClassExpression
    which basically assigns precedence to 'or'
    Reversing the calls fixes the issue.

    Manchester OWL syntax cleanup

commit 6b1d946a739fa96ab8d8cf577546c512550f1f5f
Author: ignazio <ignazio.palmisano@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 3 22:09:06 2013 +0100

    Made ParserException to extend OWLParserException, and
    OWLParserException a runtime exception.
    
    This simplifies parser code as there is less need of declaring
    exceptions all exceptions thrown by a parser are caught anyway in the
    parser factory to create UnparsableOntologyException, so the
    checked exceptions never bubble to the surface anyway.

    Fixes #46 Round tripping error in functional syntax
    
    Some axioms that violate OWL specs can be written out in functional
    syntax but cannot be parsed back in.
    Added tests in the functional syntax renderer to skip these axioms,
    so the output can be roundtripped.

    Refactored property hierarchy to remove generics. Introduced Searcher.
    
    A large amount of generics in OWLPropertyExpression was there only
    to support convenience methods to search through ontologies.
    Simplified this by removing the convenience methods and introduced a
    class to write customizable searches.
    
    Searcher is still embryonal. It currently relies on convenience
    methods in OWLOntology. It should evolve to use ontology internals
    to simplify and speed up searches and filters.

    removed useless checks in equals()

    Fix infinite recursion on cyclic import structures.
    
    If owl:imports iri declarations do not match the imported ontology IRI
    and there is a cycle in the imports closure, the parsing goes into an
    infinite recursion. Cycle broken by detecting the cycles on the
    owl:imports IRIs rather than waiting for the ontologies to appear in
    the manager index.

    Allow override of DefaultPrefixManager in PrefixOWLOntologyFormat
    
    This adds constructors and methods to inject dependencies. V4 has
    better interfaces that makes this more useful.
    
    Note this does not allow to determine the order of prefixes in the
    output. There is more code needing cleanup in the storers and renderers.

    Added method to OWLOntologyLoaderConfiguration to disable cross protocol
    redirects on URLConnections.
    
    URLConnection by default follows up to five redirects on the same

    Now following redirects across protocols is enabled by default, and can
    be disabled through a configuration option.
    
    Published interface change: extended OWLOntologyLoaderConfiguration.

    Fix 360 - Axiom annotations are not parsed correctly.
    
    Multiple problems here:
    - Turtle parser doing blank nodes its own way rather than using NodeID.
    - AbstractTranslator not taking into account blank nodes as annotation
    values.
    
    There is redundancy in how to check/manage blank nodes, and in
    translating stuff. Too intricated to fix here.

    properly.
    
    Added the ability to write declarations first, so all declarations
    appear before the entities are used.

    Changed VersionInfo message default to provide more information.
    
    Added a unit test to warn when there is a mismatch between pom version
    and VersionInfo version.
    Maven releases appear to work as expected, however intermediate
    snapshots might not provide a meaningful version. Changed the default
    to be the same as the maven pom version; if no pom file can be found,
    fail the test - it is neither a maven build, nor a release.

Author: ignazio1977 <ignazio1977@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Sat Dec 1 23:52:49 2012 +0000

    Hack literal creation to cater for W3C tests.
    
    Some W3C tests require "01"^^int and "1"^^int to be different, as well
    as "0.0"^^float and "-0.0"^^float.
    
    In between other stuff, this causes HermiT tests to fail.
    
    Added unit test to make sure this keeps working through literal
    optimisations.

    Memory optimisations inparticular optimisations that centre around implementations of OWLDatatype
    
    - Modified the various data factories to return singleton objects for distinguished entities such as owl:Thing.  Added a test case to ensure that this is the behaviour of the reference implementation factories.
    - Added a new implementation of OWLDatatype for OWL2Datatypes.  The implementation ensures a singleton object for each value of the OWL2Datatype enum.  It also has optimised methods that take advantage of the enum objects.

    Modified the consumer so that it tries to parse annotation assertions whose values are IRIs whilst streaming.  For some reason, the consumer wasn't doing this (leading to lots of unnecessary memory usage in some situations).  Also modified parsing to delay adding annotation axioms until the whole ontology document has been parsed (this helps to reduce peak memory usage).  Modified parsing so that axioms corresponding to "base triples" for reified axioms are only removed at the end of parsing (needed because of the delayed adding of annotation axioms).

    Fix for 3175663.  The only module that depends on OWLDataFactoryVocabulary is the reasoner module.  As this itself is an implementation module, it is fine for it to use OWLDataFactoryImpl and therefore depend on the impl module.  I've removed OWLDataFactoryVocabulary completely.

    Modified the RDFRendererBase so that if the option to insert missing type triples (declarations) is enabled they are actually added for entities that do not have any "defining" axioms.  Previously, missing type triples (declarations) were only added for an entity if that entity had some "defining" axioms.
    
    Also, modified the OWLRDFConsumer so that if the consumer is not in strict mode, it is aware of all xsd datatypes - even ones that aren't are not OWL 2 datatypes.
    
    This fixes issue 3184131.
