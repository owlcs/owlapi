[Term]
id: GO:0000108
name: obsolete repairosome
namespace: cellular_component
def: "OBSOLETE. A stable complex of proteins that carry out the DNA damage recognition and incision reactions characteristic of nucleotide excision repair (NER), such as DNA damage recognition, DNA helix unwinding, and endonucleolytic cleavage at sites flanking damaged DNA; includes TFIIH subunits and additional polypeptides; may form in the absence of DNA damage." [PMID:10681587, PMID:9852079]
comment: This term was made obsolete because 'repairosome' has fallen out of use in the literature, and the large complex described in the definition has not been confirmed to exist. The term has also confused annotators.

def: "OBSOLETE. Any process that regulates transcription such that the target genes are transcribed as part of the G1 phase of the mitotic cell cycle." [GOC:dph, GOC:mah, GOC:tb]
comment: This term was made obsolete because it is unclear exactly what it means. It could mean either 'regulation of transcription during phase X' or 'regulation of transition between phase X and phase Y'.
