     * The <code>toString</code> method for class <code>Object</code>
     * returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the
     * object is an instance, the at-sign character `<code>@</code>', and
     * the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the
     * object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the

     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())
     * </pre></blockquote>
